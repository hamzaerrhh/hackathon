# ðŸ¤– GeekInstitute AI Hackathon Project

Welcome to our project for the **GeekInstitute Hackathon**! ðŸš€  
In this event, we will **learn, build, and implement AI models using Python**.  
Our goal is to explore how machine learning can solve real-world problems while gaining hands-on experience as a team.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

We aim to:

1. Learn the basics of AI/ML (data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training).
2. Build and train simple machine learning models in Python.
3. Apply these models to solve a real-world challenge provided during the hackathon.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **NumPy** & **Pandas** â†’ Data handling
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** â†’ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â†’ Classical ML models
- **Jupyter Notebook** â†’ Experimentation & demos

(Optional: TensorFlow / PyTorch if deep learning is explored)
